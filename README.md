# GreeenAware-API

### Greenaware, is concerned with the climate changes caused by 
### Global Warming.  Greenaware’s mission is to collect data to improve awareness and drive predictive modelling initiatives with the overarching goals of supporting scientific research and affecting government policy.

Greenaware’s services will allow climate-change conscious individuals and groups around the Earth to register 
and contribute by providing climate readings and observations related to their local regions at intervals. 
What3words a ‘proprietary geocode system designed to identify any location on the surface of Earth with a 
resolution of about 3 meters' (What3words, n.d.), will be used to convey precise geographic coordinates. 
Registered contributors, termed ‘Observers’ will first have to complete an online educational course before
qualifying to contribute data. They will then be paid a monthly stipend to their accounts as a token of gratitude 
for their support.
